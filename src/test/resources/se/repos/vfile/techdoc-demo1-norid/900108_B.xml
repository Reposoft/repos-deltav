<li><p>Carefully
read the instructions and make sure you understand their meaning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure
the whole of the working area and area for folding out the sections
are free. Never walk under a suspended section! Always check that
the automatic stoppers have been locked during transport and parking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not
stand between the tractor and the machine when the tractor is reversed
to hitch the seed drill.</p></li>
<li><p>Warning
tape, watch out for the risk of crushing or impact. Also used on safety-related
parts</p></li>
<li><p>Watch your
feet. Risk of pinching.</p></li>
<li><p>Always
make sure that the working area of the bout markers is free from obstructions!
Keep in mind that there is a risk of injury when the bout markers
are extended and there is a risk of crushing between the seed drill
and the bout markers when they are retracted.</p>
<note>
<p>The bout markers are always retracted
when the machine is lifted no matter what is shown on the control
box. The indicated bout markers are always extended when the machine
is lowered. Therefore, when the machine is not in the field, always
block the bout markers with the catches and switch off the Control
Station. The control box will keep all settings in the memory when
it is switched off.</p>
</note>
</li>
<li><p>Do not
climb on to the seed drill unit packer wheels when the machine is
parked, as they can rotate.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure
nobody is on the seed drill when it is moving.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure
nobody is on the seed drill when loading seed.</p></li>
<li><p>The ladder
and platform on the machine are not intended to be used for manual
loading from small sacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Warning
of piercing oil jet; the hydraulic system includes accumulators that
are pressurised. Before performing servicing or repairs, the hydraulic
system pressure must be released, see "5.7 Emptying the hydraulic
system accumulators" on page 88.</p></li>
<li><p>Following
10-15 km of transport on the road, retighten the wheel nuts. Retighten
the nuts similarly after changing wheels. Tighten the nuts using a
torque wrench. See "5.2 General" on page 83.</p></li>
<li><p>Use ear
defenders when adjacent to the running fan.</p></li>

cms:rlogicalid="x-svn:///svn/demo1^/vvab/xml/sections/Other%20safety%20regulations.xml?p=81">
<title>Other safety regulations</title>
<itemlist>
<li><p>Never crawl
under the machine chassis unless the seed drill unit is lowered onto
the support frame and the yellow-marked hydraulic hoses are disconnected
from the tractor.</p></li>
<li><p>The platform
must be kept clean so that there is no risk of slipping.</p></li>
<li><p>When transporting
the seed drill on public roads, show good judgement and drive carefully.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We recommend
the use of a tractor with a gross weight that is at least equal to
the gross weight of the seed drill, if the seed drill is not equipped
with brakes. Note that transport of a seed drill that is not equipped
with brakes and has a full seed hopper is not permitted on public
roads. National legislation must always be complied with!</p></li>
<li><p>The rearwards
view is very limited. Check the positioning of the rear view mirrors
on the tractor.</p></li>
<li><p>The owner/driver
has sole responsibility when transporting the seed drill on a public
road.</p></li>
<li><p>In order
to avoid any risk arising by accidental operation of the tractor's
hydraulic controls during road transport, the yellow-marked hydraulic
hoses to the seed drill unit must be disconnected from the tractor
before transport driving begins.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure
that at least 20% of the tractor's weight is still being carried by
its front wheels when the seed drill has been connected and loaded.
This is to ensure that the steering ability of the whole vehicle is
maintained.</p></li>
<li><p>This machine/equipment
and its tyres are designed for a maximum speed of 30 km/h for transportation
on the public highway.</p></li>
<li><p>Always
park the implement on a level and solid surface. The seed drill unit
must be lowered when parking.</p></li>
<li><p>Always
make sure that the hydraulic quick connector couplings on the seed
drill and the tractor are free of dirt prior to connecting hoses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To maintain
the high level of quality and operational safety, use only Väderstad
genuine spare parts. The warranty and any claim commitments will become
void if other than genuine parts are used.</p></li>
<li><p>Any welding
work on the machine/implement must be carried out to a professional
standard.Note that imperfect welding may result in serious injuries
or fatality.If in doubt, contact a professional welding service for
proper instructions.</p></li>

<numlist>
<li><p>Attach
the control box securely in the tractor cab. The control box should
be installed within the field of vision when driving forwards. Install
the bracket as shown in the illustration.</p>
<note>
<p>Prior to any drilling in the tractor
cabin, be sure to check for any concealed wiring that may be present.</p>
</note>
</li>
<li><p>Connect
the Control Station to the electrical socket on the tractor. If an
electrical power outlet is not available, extra wiring must be installed.
Preferably use 6 mm² cable. Connect the cables: brown to plus (+)
and blue to ground (-).</p>
<note>
<p>Do not reverse the polarity!</p>
</note>
<note>
<p>It is important to have good wiring connections,
as a loose connection will prevent correct operation.</p>
</note>
<note>
<p>Do not use a cigarette lighter outlet,
as the current consumption is up to 20 A.</p>
</note>
<note>
<p>Make sure the connection cable to the
seed drill is not pinched under the rear window of the tractor, since
this cable can be easily damaged. Use the designated connector port
or cable lead-through. Securely clamp the cable in the tractor cab.
This protects the Control Station from damage in case the connection
cable has inadvertently not been disconnected prior to unhitching
the drill.</p>

<p>To minimise damaging soil compaction,
the tractor used to tow the seed drill should be equipped with extra
wide tyres, e.g. double installation of Twin wheels or similar. Try
to have as low tyre pressure as possible. Any front weights on the
tractor should be removed.</p>
